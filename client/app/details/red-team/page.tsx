                            Understanding these advanced red team prompt engineering strategies helps security teams anticipate
                            realistic attack scenarios. By employing these sophisticated methods in regular red teaming exercises,
                            teams can better evaluate the strength of their defensive measures, ensuring continuous improvement of LLM
                            security protocols and prompt engineering robustness.
